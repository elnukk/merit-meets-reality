The animations and data visualizations ob this website was made using p5.js library. I have leveraged its resources on [its official website](https://p5js.org/) throughly. I had built projects with p5.js before so I wanted to use my experience and knowledge and apply it to our challenge. I improved on my skills a lot by trying out new things.
I used Claude (an AI chatbot) when I kept seeing an error about unrecognized option 'hmr'. It responded suggesting that this is a compatibility issue with packages I was using. I removed and re-installed the packages, which ended up fixing the issue.
I also re-used the styling from my previous projects instead of freshly writing the css code. This helped me focus more on the content and visualizations.
